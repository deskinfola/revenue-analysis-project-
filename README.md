2.	Revenue Growth is Stagnant: From 2010 to 2011, revenue increased by less than 1%, indicating flat performance over time.
3.	Product Revenue is Skewed: Eva Water alone contributed 38% of total product revenue, showing over-dependence on a single product line.
4.	Missed Optimization Opportunities: There is potential to increase revenue by improving the performance of underperforming sales staff and promoting less popular products.
